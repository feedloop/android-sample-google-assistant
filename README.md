You can try the App Actions by following these steps:

1. Build and run the sample on your physical test device (**Run "app"**).
2. Open the App Actions test tool (**Tools > Google Assistant > App Actions Test Tool**).
3. Define an invocation name to use for invoking the App Actions (like "my test app"). This name is only for testing purposes, so it can be different from what you want to deploy to production later.
4. Click **Create Preview**. Once your preview is created, the test tool window updates to display information about BIIs found in your `shortcuts.xml` file.

After you create a preview, you can then try using voice or written commands directly with Assistant on your test device.

If you run into any issues, check out the [troubleshooting guide](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/troubleshoot) in our developer documentation.
